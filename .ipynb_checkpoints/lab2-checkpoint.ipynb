    "In this part of the lab we'll run terminal commands in a github repository to build a website using Quarto.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then use the exiting GitHub infrastructure publish this website on the internet. You will make a small edit to the base template, and are free to use this as a starting point to build out your professional data science presence.\n",

    "#### Recommended order of tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "The end goal is to have a github repository with a rendered quarto website. You can either opt to create everything locally first (think `git init`) or create the repository first and then bring it down to your computer (think `git clone`). There are differences in each method, but the end product will be the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a github repository (the public github, not enterprise) with the following pattern: `USERNAME.github.io`, replace `USERNAME` with your actual github username\n",
    "2. Pre-populate it with a `README.md` file and a creative commons licence. You can also choose a premade `.gitignore` file as well, this won't matter too much foir this particular lab section.\n",
    "3. Bring down the github repository to your local computer\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Build and publish the Quarto website\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go through the Quarto Website Docs to create and build your website: https://quarto.org/docs/websites/\n",
    "2. Push all the relevant files to the github repository\n",
    "3. Have github render the default tmeplate website\n",
    "4. Make a change to the template website\n",
    "    - Introduce yourself to the world, you can do this on the main homepage, or in a dedicated About page\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Link the website to us"
